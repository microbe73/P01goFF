## Description
goFindFriends (goFF) is a friendship simulation game in which users can match with randomly generated user profiles which showcases their name, bio, age, etc. If users are found to be compatible with one another, they will also be able to simulate what it’s like to have a friendly conversation by engaging in a fun trivia game based on the other user’s interests.

## Haikus
To find friends is hard.
To communicate harder.
So rely on us.

## Launch Codes
Prerequisites:
    Python 3 is installed and necessary environment variables are setup properly.

Clone repo:
    <br>
    In the directory you want to have the code in, type into a terminal
    <br>
    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:microbe73/P01goFF.git
    ```
    
Create a virtual environment (unless you already have one):
    <br>
    A virtual environment can be created using the following line in a terminal 
    <br>
    ```
    $ python3 -m venv ~/path/to/virtual/environment/directory
    ```
    <br>
    The virtual environment can then be activated by being in the right directory, then typing the following line in a terminal
    <br>
    ```
    $ source (name of virtual environment directory)/bin/activate
    ```
    <br>
    To then install the required packages, navigate to this repository, and enter in the following with the virtual environment activated:
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    <br>
    cd into the goFF repo
    <br>
    Then cd again to app
